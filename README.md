React Dashboard Test Project
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This is a **test dashboard project** with user pages and logs, designed to practice modern React architecture and popular libraries.  
The project aims to demonstrate:

- **Global state management** with Zustand
- **Server data fetching** with TanStack Query
- **Data display** with TanStack Table
- **UI design** using Tailwind CSS
- **Routing** with React Router v7
- **Form handling** with React Hook Form
- **Notifications** with react-hot-toast
- **A simple and extendable architecture and Clean Architecture** for real-world projects


## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project is a **test dashboard** where all key features have been implemented following modern React best practices.  
The project has been structured to move towards a **Clean Architecture**, with separate folders and files for:

- Pages (`/pages`)
- Routes (`/routes`)  
- Components (`/components`)  
- Layouts (`/layout`)  
- State management stores (`/store`)  
- API and data fetching logic (`/services/queries`)  
- Utilities and hooks (`/hooks`)  

The goal of this approach is to maintain **modularity, readability, and scalability**, making it easier to extend or maintain the project in the future.  
All project requirements, including login, user list, user details, editable table with pagination, and user logs, have been implemented inside the project while following this architecture.
