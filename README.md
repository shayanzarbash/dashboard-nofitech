- **Server data fetching** with TanStack Query
- **Data display** with TanStack Table
- **UI design** using Tailwind CSS
- **Routing** with React Router v7
- **Form handling** with React Hook Form

- **A simple and extendable architecture and Clean Architecture** for real-world projects


## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project is a **test dashboard** where all key features have been implemented following modern React best practices.  
The project has been structured to move towards a **Clean Architecture**, with separate folders and files for:

- Pages (`/pages`)
- Routes (`/routes`)  
- Components (`/components`)  
- Layouts (`/layout`)  
- State management stores (`/store`)  
- API and data fetching logic (`/services/queries`)  
- Utilities and hooks (`/hooks`)  

### Decision to choose a library and architecture:
- **Tailwind CSS** was used for styling due to the small size of the project and the simplicity of the UI design.  
- **Zustand** was chosen for state management because of the simple project structure; it provides a lightweight and easy way to handle global state.  
- The project follows a **Clean Architecture approach** as much as possible, while also keeping a simple structure suitable for small projects.  
- **React Hook Form** was used for handling the login form, including built-in validation, which made form management straightforward and efficient.
